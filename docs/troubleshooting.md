# Troubleshooting Guide

## Authentication Errors

### Login Issues

**Error Message:**  
<span class="error-message">Error: Invalid identifier or password</span>

**Checklist:**
1. Username and Password Entry
   - Check for any accidental spaces
   - If copying and pasting, ensure no extra characters were included

2. Username Format
   - Correct format: `your-username.bsky.social`
   - Common mistake: `your-username` (missing .bsky.social)

3. Password Information
   - We strongly recommend using an [App Password](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords) instead of your regular password
   - App Password format: `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` (19 characters)
   
::: tip Helpful Tips
Don't confuse the App Password with the "password name" shown in settings.
How to create a new App Password:
2. [Navigate to App Passwords section](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords)
3. Click "Add App Password"
4. Click "Create App Password"
4. Copy the generated 19-character password

3. Try logging in again

## Rate Limit Errors

**Error Message:**  
<span class="error-message">Error: Rate limit error</span>

**Solution:**
1. Bluesky API has the following limits ([official documentation](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/rate-limits)):
   - Up to 5,000 points per hour (approximately 1,666 new actions)
   - Up to 35,000 points per day
   - Points per action:
     - Create: 3 points
     - Update: 2 points
     - Delete: 1 point
2. If you hit the limit, wait until the limit resets
3. Click the "Restart" button to try again

::: warning
The version published on Firefox frequently encounters rate limit errors. If you encounter an error, please try it on Chrome.
:::

::: tip
Most users won't hit these limits during normal usage. However, be mindful when performing bulk actions like following many users or liking many posts in a short period.
